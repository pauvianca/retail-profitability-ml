# Retail Store Profitability Classification Using CRISP-DM and Orange

ðŸ“„ This research was completed for my *Machine Learning* module at the University of Stirling.  
It applies the CRISP-DM methodology using the **Orange** visual programming tool to build a machine learning classifier that predicts whether a store will be profitable based on various business and demographic features.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Summary

- Business context: Help retail businesses predict store profitability for investment decisions
- Dataset: 136 instances with operational, demographic, and competitive features
- Tool: Orange (visual ML workflow)
- Models tested: Logistic Regression, SVM, Gradient Boosting
- Best result: Logistic Regression (AUC = 0.914)

## ðŸ§° Methods Used

- CRISP-DM framework
- Feature selection and engineering
- Normalisation and data preprocessing
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, MCC, AUC
- Error analysis with confusion matrix

## ðŸ“Ž Files Included

- `ML_Profitability_Report.pdf` â€“  Read-only version
